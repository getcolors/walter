  "Stamp the bundled launcher with the commit a standalone copy should resolve.

  This is a maintainer command for this repository, not something a user of the
  skill ever runs: it reads the HEAD of the checkout it is invoked in, so
  anywhere else it would stamp an unrelated SHA. That is why it lives in bb.edn
  rather than as a launcher subcommand — a payload copied into a stranger's
  project should not carry a command that is wrong by construction there.

  Walter's launcher pins only walter. `once` and `green` come transitively from
  walter's deps.edn, so there is one site here rather than ONCE's three."
